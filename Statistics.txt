Mean - The average value
Median - The mid point value
Mode - The most common value


Standard deviation:

Standard deviation is a number that describes how spread out the values are.
A low standard deviation means that most of the numbers are close to the mean (average) value.
A high standard deviation means that the values are spread out over a wider range.

Variance:
Variance is another number that indicates how spread out the values are.

standard deviation = square root of the variance

Population and Sample:
Population:
A population is the collection of all items of interest to our study and is usually denoted with an uppercase N.

Sample: 
A sample is a subset of the population and is denoted with a lowercase n.
A part of the population drawn according to a rule or plan for concluding characteristics is called a sample.
Sample size
The number of items in a sample is called a sample size
